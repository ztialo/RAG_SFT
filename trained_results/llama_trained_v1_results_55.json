As they go through life on earth, searching for peace and knowledge.\nAnd finally there\u2019s always  something left unspoken\nA Beast's Nature: An Exploration of Grand Mother Silk as a Divine Entity \n\nThe existence and worship of Grand Mother Silk can be found through the writings of various philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, or Stoic thinkers. These ancient concepts have inspired countless works of literature in  classical Greece and Rome, particularly those dealing with spirituality, nature, philosophy.\n\nGrand Mother Silk is considered a divine entity because of its mysterious ability to weave together peace, faith, and knowledge. The intricacies within Grand Mother's threads appear  to hold multiple planes or dimensions, inviting both contemplation and awe. According to these ancient philosophers, their understanding of the mysteries hidden within Golden Hour. In literature this concept represents more than just any ordinary silk, however intricate its fabric is.\nTherefore, when one reads about Grand Mother Silk in various texts such as  \u201cThe Interpretation of the Divine in a work titled \u201cPerseus\u2019s\u201d Epic\nfrom Greek mythology and literature, it becomes clear that her attributes are described with utmost reverence within classical works, showing the admiration of people throughout Greece and Rome to divine entities. \n\nHere is an attempt to put some ideas into words: Grand Mother Silk represents spirituality through its ability to weave together peace, faith, and knowledge. This poetic exploration focuses on the intricate patterns in silk threads that can hold multiple planes or dimensions \u2013 inviting contemplation and awe.\n\nThe theme of Golden Hour becomes central when one considers Socrates\u2019 quote that \u201cKnowing more than, but not knowing less; that\u2019s enough.\u201d Grand Mother Silk embodies this quote as it allows people to gain insight into the mysteries hidden within silk threads. In the same vein, ancient Greek philosophers revered divine entities such as Isis and Dionysus, who embodied mystical forces.\n\nIn contrast to these traditional figures from Greek mythology, our focus shifts to more modern representations like Bugs  and Grand Mother Silk that depict a different kind of divine entity. While both might seem vastly different in terms of their religious beliefs, they demonstrate how diverse is the nature of spirituality within literature across history.\n\n\nThe beauty of this exploration lies not only in its unique perspective on Grand Mother Silk as a creature but also in its ability to bring together contrasting elements from literature and philosophy.\n\nIt seems that you may be referring to The Interpretation of the Divine, written by Socrates."

Many players found that their in-game saves, including characters from previous DLCs added via DLCs like Hollow\nKnight: 2017 only contained bug fixes for  those errors.\nAs you can probably infer due to this lack of effort on the part of the developers, many bugs were introduced through new items as they entered these areas. One such item that stands out was a new, invisible 4x4 patcher with 60% accuracy. But what happened next is that users realized something fishy with regards to game-saving behavior.

But for a small price in this world.\n\nThe item was built by Pharlo 1, not Chorus  bug who created The Weavers. It seems that Pharloom\u2019s design is different than Hallownest\u2019s.  Here we have a different object which Pharo is building to serve as the Farsight, rather than simply allowing them to observe over vast distances without any change in game state whatsoever.\n\nThe item has no relation to anything else except for its name.\n\nAs part of Silksong lore, Pharlo 1 built  the item under pressure from Chorubug. The design of this object is different when compared to Chorobugg\u2019s methods, meaning it does not use any alteration or modification of game state whatsoever in order to function as described by this text.\n\nNow let's get into Silksong lore and check out Farsight\n\nLet\u2019s say Hornet discovers the item after she\u2019s caught by The Weavers. It seems Pharloom doesn\u2019t belong to Chorubugg, which was more focused on capturing people than fighting against them (in a word:  mercenary). If we follow the lore closely, Pharlo is not simply manipulating game state or hiding secrets, but rather is working with Pharoo\u2019s methods of creating objects that reveal hidden truths.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to decide if Chorobugg and The Weavers are allies or rivals; their motives were different; one is focused on capturing people using force, while the other focuses solely on observing a world unseen by all except for Hornet. Chorobugg was  created when Pharoo met Eirabon , which shows that even though Pharolo might have been working alone before building Farsight , their methods were different.\n\nPharolb is probably built to serve more than one purpose in this world, but it doesn\u2019t exist on his own; he appears alongside other Weavers. He could be related to the Pale King  and Chorok in some manner.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what kind of object Pharalb was trying to create when building Farsight, and what its relation to The Weavers stands\n\nPharloom is different from Chorobugg; Pharoo doesn\u2019t exist on his own. It seems that the item\u2019s purpose lies with Pharolb rather than any member of the team.\n\nPharloom shows a potential connection between both Chorok  and Pale King, which adds more to our understanding of Hallownest lore\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, it appears that Pharlum is created using a different architecture from what Chorobugg uses \n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, Pharloom was built by Pharolb, not Pharo."

With the Everbloom in hand, Hornet returns  to Deep Docks, where Ballow has fixed the Diving Bell. Hornet descends into the Abyss again,  where Lace stops her to chat one more time saying: Take the final plunge, spider. Join us in my  drowning palace, and let oblivion swallow us all. Horner rebuffs Lace, saying: Oblivion may take you, child. My  own life,\nstrength, Hornet will choose to save another from the Void  instead of sacrificing an entire generation of offspring to it. Hornet\u2019s resolve is reflected  in the journal entry for Lost Lace which reads: To quell the mother's rage,  and see this kingdom saved, I will claim her back. This  one... the dark shall not take. Hornet awakens in the Snail Shamans\u2019 hut, but all  three of them are now gone save for their shells.

They are often called upon by those in need; some Snail Shamans are immortal or undead, serving both sides. When fighting Snail Shamans, they fight on feet and can be healed with mana restored to them.\n\nThey have high damage potential if hit enough times, deal massive damage when dead, but cannot regenerate unless fully cured of their poison status.\n\nWhen used for magic spells, including casting a spell called Oblivion, an undead creature does not regenerate unless fully cured  of their poison status. Snail Shamans also gain access to some mana points.\nSnail Shamans are passive allies that can provide healing effects.\n\n### Final Result:\n\nThe three Snail Shamans seem to have used all their energy when casting the spell and faded into nothingness.\n\n### Description:\nWhen the spell is cast, all of Lace's minions disappear because they were summoned using magic by Phantom. The undead creatures use their magical property on Phantom."

She can break bread with bugs still in control of their senses. And she can even learn to  play almost 10 whole songs on her Needolin. Hornet can even stumble upon a strange cult of  burning bugs obsessed with flame. Deep within the thicket, Hornet can find the Father of  the Flame, a giant totem and god containing the\nquest, where Greyroot injects  Hornet with a parasite that limits her Silk and removes her ability to equip tools. To  remove the parasite, Hornet must seek help from Yarnaby in Greymoor, a doctor kicked out of  Bellhart for her questionable medical practices. But Hornet can actually just keep adventuring  around Pharloom instead of dealing with the parasite immediately. This can lead to some  interesting interactions.
